# AI Agent Project

## Overview
This project contains Python scripts and tools designed to facilitate AI Agent functionalities. It includes core scripts for running the AI agent, utility tools, and configuration files to manage dependencies and environment setup.

One of the key components is the `groq_tool.py` script, which provides an interface to query the GROQ API. The GROQ API is an AI-powered chat completion service that uses the "llama3-70b-8192" model to generate helpful responses to natural language queries. This allows the AI Agent to leverage advanced language understanding and generation capabilities.

## Project Structure
- `main.py`: The main entry point script for the AI Agent.
- `groq_tool.py`: A specialized tool script related to the AI Agent.
- `tools.py`: Utility functions and helper scripts.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists the Python dependencies required for the project.

## Installation
To set up the project environment, ensure you have Python 3.7 or higher installed. Then install the required dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
To run the AI Agent, execute the main script:

```bash
python main.py
```


## Features
- Modular design with separate scripts for core functionality and tools.
- Easy dependency management via `requirements.txt`.
- Extensible utility functions in `tools.py`.
